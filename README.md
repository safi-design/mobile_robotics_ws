1. Introduction: 

  

This document provides a step-by-step guide on implementing a wall-following behavior for a TurtleBot3 robot using ROS (Robot Operating System) and Python. The wall-following algorithm utilizes laser scan data to detect obstacles and adjust the robot's velocity and angular velocity accordingly. 

  

2. Requirements: 

  

- ROS (Robot Operating System) 

- TurtleBot3 Simulation Environment 

- Python 3.x 

- `geometry_msgs` and `sensor_msgs` ROS packages 

  

3. Implementation Steps: 

  

Step 1: Initialize ROS Core 

  

```bash 

$ roscore 

``` 

  

 

 

 

 

 

 

Step 2: Set TurtleBot3 Model 

  

```bash 

$ export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger 

``` 

  

Step 3: Launch TurtleBot3 in Gazebo 

  

```bash 

$ roslaunch turtlebo3_gazebo turtlebot3_stage1.launch 

``` 

  

Step 4: Navigate to Workspace 

  

```bash 

$ cd mobile_robotics 

``` 

  

Step 5: Source Setup Script 

  

```bash 

$ source devel/setup.sh 

``` 

  

 

 

 

Step 6: Run Wall-Follower Node 

  

```bash 

$ rosrun wall_follower wall_follower.py 

``` 

  

4. Wall-Follower Python Code Explanation: 

  

The provided Python script `wall_follower.py` implements the wall-following behavior. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its key components: 

  

- PID Controller Parameters: Defines the proportional, integral, and derivative constants for the PID controller. 

- Wall-Following Parameters: Sets the threshold for detecting obstacles, and the robot's move and rotation speeds. 

- Laser Callback Function: Handles laser scan data, calculates errors, and adjusts the robot's velocity and angular velocity. 

- ROS Initialization: Initializes the ROS node, publisher, and subscriber. 

- ROS Loop: Continuously runs the wall-follower algorithm. 

  

5. Conclusion: 

  

By following the steps outlined in this document and understanding the provided Python code, you can successfully implement a wall-following behavior for a TurtleBot3 robot using ROS and Python.
